Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
"""

i = 4
d = 4.0

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
j = int(input("Type in an integer: "))
e = float(input("Type in a float: "))
t = str(input("Type in a string: "))
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+j)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d+e)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
